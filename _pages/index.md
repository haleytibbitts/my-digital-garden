    <h1>howdy! welcome to my [[digital garden]]! âœ§ðŸ¦‹(â—•â€¿â—•âœ¿)</h1>

    <p>here you'll find resources i've collected and thoughts i have on a wide variety of topics that inspire me, reflect my values, and feed my insatiable appetite for learning cool shizz! think of it less like a traditional blog and more of a free-form personal notebook, where there's no need for polish or performance.</p>

    <p>in an increasingly unstable digital world, this is my effort to carve out a corner of the internet where i can reliably preserve the things that feel important; for myself, and whoever else may be interested in the same things!</p>

    <p>for a visual representation of everything i have here thus far, check out my [[node map]].</p>
