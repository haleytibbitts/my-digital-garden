## What is Digital Gardening?

- a new approach to publishing knowledge on the web
- departure from traditional blogging conventions
- free-form work in progress wikis
- **independant ownership**; cultivating ur own internet/system of knowledge that you will always be able to access
- **exploratory**; priority on contextual relationships instead of timeline
- **continuous growth**; never "finished", always growing and evolving
- **imperfection & learning in public**; less performative, more authentic. in between the chaos stream of twitter/discord and classic blogging/research papers
- more personal and customizeable in terms of both content and form
- content diversity is encouraged

## Structure & Optional Features

- topography based: things are linked together by context and associative links
  - bi-directional links (showing which pages link to the pages that ur currently on)
  - organizing ideas: thematic piles, nested folders, tags & filtering functionality, advanced search bars, visual node graphs, central indexes...
- labels for different statuses: rough/early ideas, work you've cleaned up and clarified, work that is reasonably complete.
- meta-reflection tags: topic tags, start and end date, stage tag (draft, in progress, finished), certainty tag (impossible, unlikely, certain), 1-10 importance tag.
