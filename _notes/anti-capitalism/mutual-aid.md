## What is Mutual Aid?

- today for you, tomorrow for me
- taking care of each other and building community, moving away from capitalism and colonialism
- support that exposes system's failure and shows alternative, shows power of people, uplifts
- sharing skills builds autonomy within a community
  - community knowledge is community strength
- breaking norms of individualism, passivity, and prioritizing private property over individual need
- horizontal community organizing, not hierarchal
- "no masters, no flakes"; your contribution matters

## Charity is Not Mutual Aid

- rich folks giving money to poor folks, not mutual
- upholding systems that create poverty
- stigmatization of those who are in need
- saviourist, paternalist, only for image

## Beware of Intention vs. Output

with our efforts, are we...

- seizing space in which new social relations can be enacted?
- encouraging passive awareness, or are we inspiring others to fight?
- providing material relief?
- cultivating libertory skills?
- cultivating sharing practices?
- leaving out an especially marginalized part of the affected group?
- developing solidarity across movements?
- improving peoples lives without support from elites?
- legitimizing or expanding a system we are trying to dismantle?
- relying on harmful institutions? if so, how can we move away from them?
