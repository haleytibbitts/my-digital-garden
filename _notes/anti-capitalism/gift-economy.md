## What is the Gift Economy?

- community = gift economy
  - doing things for others, they feel gratitude towards you, they want to do things for you in return
  - even if the person you help doesn't have anything to offer, the community will see your generosity and help you
  - if you're selfish, no one will want to take care of you
  - ==system rewards generosity and punishes selfishness==
- gift economy is "bad" for the market economy
  - eg. if sharing one bag of power tools within a community, less people spending money on power tools
- economy of gifts encourages people to work as an =="expression of our gifts, motivated by passion, called forth by the needs, and not coerced by money"==
- money was meant to be a recognition of gratitude for your contribution, but highest paying jobs are often morally bankrupt in these times
  - alternatively, most important jobs are underpaid
- creating further class divide when poor folks are expected to pay just as much as rich people? may have other ways to contribute that aren't seen as "equal" in a market economy
  - possibly why men see workforce labour as more important than emotional & household labour?

## Gift Economy vs Market Economy vs Barter Economy

- gift economy opposes market & barter economy

| Market                                 | Barter                                 | **Gift**                                 |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Uses money                             | Uses no money                          | **Uses no money**                        |
| Getting stuff/services is the pleasure | Getting stuff/services is the pleasure | **Giving/meeting needs is the pleasure** |
| Scarcity mindset                       | Fairness mindset                       | **Abundance mindset**                    |
| Transactional                          | Transactional                          | **Gift/blessing-based**                  |

## Gift Economy in Practice

- ==buy nothing groups==: hyper local groups that pass along things you don't need (goods, services, etc.)
  - creates community bonds, fosters gift economy
- gifting events where people can give away goods and services for free
- ==fb buy nothing==, ==craigslist free page==, ==public libraries==, ==public radio==, ==community gardens==
- many public spaces support the market economy
  - only being able to use public washrooms if you're a paying customer
  - coffee shops and restaurants being a popular meeting places
- a true gift economy encourages interdependant communities instead of hyperindependence
- gift economy should be ==voluntary & inclusive==, ==community focused==, ==sustainability focused==, and ==non-competitive==
